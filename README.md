# Eat-the-Burger


## How the app works
This is a simple app that lets you type in the type of burger you want to eat. When you enter it in, it will add it into the database. 
If you choose to eat (devour) the burger, there is a button to do so. The burgers boolean trait in the database will reflect that it was eaten. The purpose of this app was to practice using Sequelize as a primary database. 

## Technology used
Sequelize, Javascript, Node.js
